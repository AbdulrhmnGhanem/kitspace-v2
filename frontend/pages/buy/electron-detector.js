              This open hardware project is a mobile low-cost detector for measuring
              ionising radiation like electrons from beta radiation (plus some gamma
              photons). It's an educational tool and citizen science device made for
              exploring natural and synthetic sources of radioactivity such as
              stones, airborne radon, potassium-rich salt or food and every-day
              objects (Uranium glass, old Radium watches etc.). See full project
              details <a href={projectLink}>here.</a>
